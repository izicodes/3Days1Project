  This repository showcases a collection of projects that I have developed within a three-day timeframe. Each project will show my creativity and problem-solving skills while working under constraints.

  <li><b>Fighting boredom:</b> You know those days when you're feeling super bored? Well, this challenge started on one of those days. I wanted to make sure I put my time and energy into something productive and creative! üé®</li> <br>
  <li><b>Testing creativity and problem-solving skills:</b>  The challenge is all about putting my creativity and problem-solving skills to the test. I have just three days to come up with awesome ideas and find innovative solutions to problems! üõ†Ô∏è</li> <br>
  <li><b>Fast-paced learning:</b> This challenge is all about learning new things at lightning speed. The time limits really push me to learn and implement new concepts quickly.
